# image-generator
an app that generates random images and displays online

I created this app using react.js. this app is a single page image generator that selects random image from an API source. 

I designed the outlook of the app, then added mre functionalities to it. For instance, i added 2 form of text input type,
added event listeners to display in such a way that when a new image comes up, a user can type what he wants and the result 
gets displayed as top and ottom texts on the image. 

I also uses the usefetch hook to call an external source api that generates a nundred images and used the math.random function to 
selected and display an image of the total hundred at random.

I alsoput toggle features, that toggles ack and forth light mode and dark mode.
