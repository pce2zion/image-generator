# image-generator
an app that generates random images and displays online

I created this app using react.js. This app is a single page image generator that selects random image from an external API source. 

I designed the outlook of the app, then added more functionalities to it. For instance, i added 2 forms of text input type,
added event listeners to display in such a way that when a new image comes up, a user can type what he wants and the result 
gets displayed as top and bottom texts on the image. 

I also uses the usefetch hook to call an external source api that had a hundred images, then i used the math.random function to 
selected and display an image of the total hundred at random.

Finally, i added toggle features, to enbale toggling back and forth light mode and dark mode.
